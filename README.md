this is a repo for huewe

huewe isn't much of a project, but it has some ideas i enjoy
for playing with philips hue lights.

i did most of the dev on my phone using pythonista
while riding the bart.

most of the time, it lives in my raspberry pi, hiding behind crap
and running a cron job to kick off fsr.py (fake sunrise)
